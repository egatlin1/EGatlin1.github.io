### Archery Demo(WIP)
Curious about how game did archery, I created this demo to give a try at it. It is still a work in progress. I plan to polish the feel of the bow and arrow more, as well as adding new game modes and arrow types with different effects.

### 2D Map Generator(WIP)
I was curious about how games created such large and detailed worlds through procedural generation, so I started to work on this as my first shot at it. It is still an early version of what I want to accomplish, but as of now you can enter a map seed, control water levels, and the reach of the polar caps. I plan to keep working on it and add; different types of boimes, give the user more control over the map generation, city generations, and allow the user to download a PNG image of their generated map for thier own uses.

### Mirror
Mirror is a game I created in Unity that is meant to feel like an old flash game. It is built around the idea of Mirroring movement in a unique type of puzzle game.

### Rain
Rain is a throwback to old arcade games, with simple and fun mechanics. Meant to feel like an arcade game from the 80s, I first created Rain in Java and later remastered and polished it in Unity.
